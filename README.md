# 2048
**2048** is a popular puzzle game played on a 4Ã—4 grid with numbered tiles that slide when the player moves them using the arrow keys. With each move, a new tile will randomly appear on an empty space with a value of either 2 or 4. The tiles slide as far as possible in the chosen direction until they are stopped by another tile or the edge of the grid. If two tiles with the same number collide during the move, they will merge into one tile with the combined value of the two tiles that collided. The resulting tile cannot merge with another tile in the same move.

* If a move causes three consecutive tiles with the same value to slide together, only the two tiles furthest in the direction of movement will merge. If all four spaces in a row or column are filled with tiles of the same value, the move parallel to that row/column will merge the first two and the last two.
* In the top-right corner, there is a score tracking the user's progress. The user's score starts at zero and increases whenever two tiles merge, based on the value of the newly merged tile. As with many arcade games, the highest score is displayed alongside the current score.
* The game is won when a tile with the value of 2048 appears on the grid, hence the name. After achieving the 2048 tile, players can continue playing (beyond the 2048 tile) to achieve higher scores. The game ends when the player has no valid moves left (no empty spaces and no adjacent tiles with the same value).**
